      <h1>Meet Our Pharmacist</h1>
      <hr>
      <p><b>Lead Compounding Pharmacist</b></p>
      <p><b><i>Dr. Catherine Wan, RPh. Pharm.D.</i></b></p>
      
      <p>Dr. Catherine Wan received her Doctor of Pharmacy and an Honors Program in Nutritional Science from the University of Toronto. She earned her Comprehensive and Advanced Non-sterile Compounding Certificate at Professional Compounding Centres of America. </p>
      <p>After losing two family members with cancers, Catherine experienced the limitation of the traditional medication. As a pharmacist, she believes providing health care to patients is more than just dispensing cookie-cutter medication for symptoms treatment. Other aspects of health are as important. </p>
      <p>During her pharmacy practice, she witnessed the life-changing benefits of compounded medicine for her patients. We need to address health as a whole and each of us is different and thus react differently to medications. This is where customized medications, nutritional and spiritual come in place. </p>
      <p>Under the care of Atria Compounding Pharmacy and Lifestyle Clinic, she is committed to provide the personalized healthcare that can benefit you and your family. </p>
